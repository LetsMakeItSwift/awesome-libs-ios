Awesome Libs is an iPhone app that allows you to test open source UI components without Xcode. You don't need computer, you don't need compiler. You simply test libraries in your iPhone so you can see how they work on a real device. [Online version](https://appetize.io/app/n67bct60a5vpbp5ccnxnrezdp8).

## FAQ üôÑ

### What's the origin of the name Awesome Libs?

Well, there are two main reasons why we did that:

1. There are many collections of popular open source libraries on GitHub. Usually these collections include the word `awesome` in their name. Examples: [awesome-ios](https://github.com/vsouza/awesome-ios), [awesome-swift](https://github.com/matteocrippa/awesome-swift), [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).

2. It's funny.
